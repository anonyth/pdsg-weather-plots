###### Weather plots

Data downloaded from NOAA's Storm Event Database, courteously trimmed by by Jonathan Mackrory, and includes events, locations, fatalities. Dictionary of terms available from the NOAA at http://www.nws.noaa.gov/directives/sym/pd01016005curr.pdf for field details. Some things under inquiry:

+ Wind and tornado event counts in CST time zones
+ Weather event type frequency in coastal western states (WA, OR, CA, AK, HI)
+ Financial damage incurred by "lake-effect" snowstorms (I'm from Ohio)
